# nanoCAD

A tiny CAD engine with a super simple syntax designed to be easily embeddable and UNIX-friendly.


## Screenshots

This is how the desktop application currently looks like:

## Embedding

This CAD engine is designed to be as tiny and compact as possible and allows you to embed it into your own application and just create a thin wrapper over it in order to display the graphics. The whole engine-only source code can be found in the `dist/` directory and you can get an idea of how to use it by looking at the implemented code for the application.
